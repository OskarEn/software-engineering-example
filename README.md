## Software Engineering, Algorithm Design and Analysis

This project follows part of the course Software Engineering, Algorithm Design and Analysis. During this course two software two software projects are included: a personal organizer and a space game. This repo will cover the personal organizer.
This will be a through process for the Personal Organizer. For the Space Invaders game I am doing the implemetation as part of the BYOA by TU Munich. This can be found [here](https://github.com/OskarEn/TUM-MYOA).

_Goals_


Use Cases
* Write some use cases for the organizer
* Create a use case diagram
 * Study use cases and include any pre-conditions, guaramtees, and triggers that may be appropriate

Class Diagrams
* Construct candidate class list
* (Through elimination and renaming) come up with base classes
* Construct class diagrams for some of the use cases

Sequence Diagrams
* Choose a scenario and draw a sequence diagram

Class Digrams: Advanced Techniques
* Add multiplicities to the associations and visibilities to the attributes and operations

State Machine Diagrams
* (for Event class) draw a state machine diagram for the lifetime behaviour of Event

Activity Diagrams
* Draw an activity diagram for an event which is scheduled to occur at a fixed time over a number of weeks. The event might have an associated email reminder which is sent to the event attendees on the day before the meeting, and an alarm is activated on the actual day of the event. The alarms is deactivated when the meeting has been finished. Any event might be cancelled at any time
